This is the source code to the SpringCard PC/SC over BLE application for Android. If you are looking for the binaries, please download the application from the Play Store or from the release section.

SpringCard PC/SC over BLE or USB are the reference applications to work with SpringCard smartcard and NFC/RFID readers over a Bluetooth Low Energy or USB connection.

Use this application together with Puck, Prox'N'Roll, and a lot of other SpringCard smartcard readers. Connect to a contact or contactless smartcard, retrieve its ATR, exchange ISO 7816 APDUs; read/write NFC tags or RFID @ 13.56MHz labels; explore and validate your own use cases.

Once ready, download the AAR in the release section and start developing your own Android application together with SpringCard products!

NB: the above-mentionned PC/SC USB devices will work only on Android devices featuring a "real" USB host port. USB on-the-go is not supported.
